# Unity-Custom-Panoramic-Skybox
A modified version of Unity's panoramic skybox shader that allows for full control of the horizontal viewing angle/stretch with auto rotation available, vertical offset, and vertical stretching.

It is especially suitable for people looking to use an actual panoramic photo and don't want it stretched out a ton vertically or are making a single viewpoint type of game and need a small skybox.
Feel free to use or modify it in any way you like!
